# BlazorBlogging

Ok so originally this was going to be a shared library with a desktop app that you could use to write to your mongodb and then you could drop the shared app as a reference in your project and it would display the same blog, unfortunately I used photino since MAUI isn't really doable on linux from what I read. Photino is only available for .NET 9 so I'm putting this on hold until I can upgrade it to .NET 10 (which is what I need it for since that what my personal site runs on)
